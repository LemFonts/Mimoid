## Designed by [Dariusz Wekwert](https://www.instagram.com/dariuszwekwert/)

The typeface is an attempt to visualization the relation and differences between Earth and Solaris - planet presented in the most famous work by Stanisław Lem. Each master is a representation of the environment.  The Planet Earth will be shown by simple letters, designed on a grid system, which relate to the structures built by humans like roads, computer systems, or architecture. Letters presenting the Solaris are going to be a test to „design” something unknown and misunderstood by humans. While the planet is covered by the ocean, the letters will be built with curves, but in a different meaning than the Earth one. The juxtaposition of these specific environments gives us huge contrast in forms, rules, and behaviours. The whole project is based on the thought of what is human and what is not.
